This is a project I worked on to display my weekly time tracking data in Toggl and display it on LEDs. A Raspberry Pi is used to retrieve the data from Toggl via their reports API and control the LED's. Files and code available to create this available at: https://github.com/edyazbec/LED-Time-Tracking-Display.
